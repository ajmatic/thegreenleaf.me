					<p>I have always wanted to learn web design and development. Well, I am taking a year off to do just that. I have been doing some form of construction for about the last decade, from building tile roofs in Los Angeles to building green homes in Connecticut. It is now time to move on to something a little easier on the body, but a little harder on the mind. </p>
					<p>My thoughts on web design are quite simple - it's like building a house. I put in a strong foundation with html and then move up to create the first floor, the exterior walls and all the rooms, inserting a body tag and filling that in with paragraphs, maybe some blockquotes, unordered lists, images, and links to other sites or projects. I would finish with css by spicing everything up and putting all the furniture, lights, and decorations in my house. Css allows me to style things the way I want. Maybe rotate an image 45 degrees or use a really cool font style. Obviously, it's a lot more in-depth than that, but either way, I know there will be a lot of long nights figuring out exactly what declarations to type in.</p>
					<p>I am lucky because I have an incredible mentor, my big sister. She is the one who pushed me to take this year off and pursue something a little more challenging. She has been coding for over half her life and now she is instilling the wisdom she gained over those years in me. So, again, I am lucky.</p>
					<p>This site will be my journey through the discovery of front-end web design. I know it will be a difficult one. I need all the help I can get and I enjoy making new friends. My contact info is to the left. Wish me luck!</p>
