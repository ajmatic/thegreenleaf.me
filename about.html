				<p>My name is Adam James, and New England is home. I split my time between Dorchester Ma., Providence RI and Norwich Ct.  I like it here in the Northeast, nothing beats NE in the fall, the summers are gorgeous and the winters are...well, tolerable.</p>
				<p>I was raised in Norwich. Twenty-five years ago it was a decent place to raise a family. I enjoyed my childhood, from my curious adolescence to my rebellious teenage years, there was rarely a dull moment and my mother swears to this day that I was the reason her hair turned white. </p>
				<p>After high school, I moved to Los Angeles. I loved that time in my life. Everything was so new, possibilities were endless, and I was going to be a rockstar. Of course, that dream was short lived, but living in Hollywood changed me.  I used to be this scrawny, cocky, long-haired kid that had no idea how to navigate the world and the people in it.  But living in the metropolis of Los Angeles and meeting some truly amazing people changed my views, values, interests, and personality.  Things continue to change for me and I'm happy about that.  I believe there is no real growth unless change happens frequently.  That's why I am on to my next adventure - coding!! </p>

				<p>I enjoy music very much. I have played the guitar since I was 15 years old. You can check out my original songs by clicking <a href="http://adamjamesmusic.net">here</a>  - I am also a huge fan of movies, living vicariously through different characters has always been one of my favorite pastimes. I also love riding motorcycles, nothing beats the feeling of riding down a canyon road when your back tire is slipping out and your yelling at yourself inside your helmet to "keep the line!" (for those of you who ride, you know what I'm talking about), of course the older I get the slower I ride.  </p>
				<p>As my life has progressed into my thirties I have learned to appreciate uncertainty.  My future is uncertain. I have no idea whether or not this web design endeavor will work out. What I have learned so far, I really like. I think it's incredible that as I sit here typing this paragraph into my code, with the touch of two buttons my words can be seen by the world. I think coding is a skill that everyone should learn a little about. I'd like to learn a lot.</p>
