			<p>I am a coding ninja.</p>  
			<p>Taken from my home when I was just a boy, I was raised by the fighting family clan of Semantic.  They taught me discipline and instilled in me the warrior spirit.  I have traveled vast distances in search of my real family, but have found nothing.  As the years go on I become more and more dangerous, honing my sharp fighting skills.  I go by many different names, so that you'll never know when I am coming.
