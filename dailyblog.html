						I have been coding for almost three weeks now.  I think I have down most of html and css.  I have learned all the element tags in html, I know the majority of the properties and their values in css, and I am slowly getting more comfortable with both of them.  The hardest part for me is not being able to look down at my keyboard while typing this content.
					</p>
					<p>
						So - my mission is to write a daily blog about all that I'm learning on that particular day.  Today, August 9th, I am creating this page that you are reading right now.
					</p>

					<h3>
						<a name="Aug9">
							August 9
						</a>
					</h3>

					<p>
						My main page is <a href="index.html" id="tag">The Green Leaf.</a> And I have just added a link to that page by putting a hyperlink tag to it.  That hyperlink tag looks a little something like this:<br> <code>&lt;a href="index.html" id="tag"&gt;</code><br>Now you can click on the link in this paragraph and go to my homepage. The <code>id=tag</code> is not necessary unless you want to do something different with the link. I wanted to make this particular link the color green, and I did that by declaring it in a css file. That's where the <code>id=tag</code> comes in handy.
					</p>
					<p>
						I reference the hyperlink in my css file by putting an octothorpe (#) in front of the word <code>tag</code>. My css code looks something like this.<br><code>#tag {color: green;}</code><br>What I've done is referenced my html code by giving the hyperlink an <code>id</code> and declaring that I want the <code>color</code> of that <code>id</code> to be green.
					</p> 
					<p>
						If I did not link up my html file with a css file (which I'll show you how to do later) the display of the link would set back to the browser's normal default setting, which would look this: <a href="index.html" id="tag2">The Green Leaf</a>
					</p><br>

					<h3>
						<a name="Aug15">

					</h3>

					<p>
						Ok, so I suppose we should start at the beginning. In order to start coding you're going to need a text editor on your computer.  I use <a href="http://www.sublimetext.com">Sublime Text</a>, it's easy to find and download, and it's free.  Once you download that (and make sure you download it for the computer you are using, i.e. - Windows, Mac) you can start coding.  When you open Sublime Text you can start your first <code>html</code> file.  A good standard practice is to call your first <code>html</code> file <code>index.html</code>, this will essentially be your homepage and when you want to put it online, your host (the server that will make your site live) will usually require that you have a file named <code>index</code>. Check out <a href="http://www.namecheap.com">NameCheap</a> to browse for domain names and they will also be able to host your site. 
					</p>
					<p>
						So, once you have your text editor you're ready to begin. All <code>html</code> documents must start off with the declaration <br><code>&lt;!doctype html&gt;</code><br>This begins your document and tells the web browser what version of html the page is written in. To understand more on this particular element go <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_doctype.asp">here</a><p>Your first tag will be an <code>&lt;html&gt;</code> tag.<br>This will have a closing tag to it.  It will look like this <code>&lt;/html&gt;</code><br> This tag will encompass everyting within your html file. Your <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> tag, paragraph <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> tags, and all other elements.  Whenever you open an element you will use these less-than and greater-than signs <code>&lt;&gt;</code> Ex. - <code>&lt;html&gt;</code> or <code>&lt;body&gt;</code>
					</P>
					<p>
						When you want to close an element you will use the same signs but add a backslash after the less-than symbol.  Ex - <code>&lt;/html&gt; or &lt;/body&gt;</code>
					</p>
					<p>
						There are many different elements, for a complete list you can go <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/tags/">here</a>.
					</p>
					<p>
						It's a little overwhelming, I know!  But once you get familiar with all the different element tags, you will be able to do so much.  We will slowly go through the majority of the elements and what they mean, but if you want to get a head start on creating your own website, <a href="http://www.w3schools.com">w3schools</a> is a great place to start.
					</p>
					<p>
						Ok, your homework for today is to download a text editor and to check out <a href="http://www.w3schools.com">w3schools</a>.  I'm going to learn a little more myself today and will be back tomorrow to go over the <code>head</code> of an html document.  Until then....
					</p>

					<h3>
						<a name="Aug16">
							August 16
						</a>
					</h3>

					<p>
						Ok, so after you have downloaded your text editor, and declared your doctype, you may put in the head of an html page.  What mine usually consist of are several things, first you need a <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> opening tag and a <code>&lt;/head&gt;</code> closing tag.  Put a few lines between the opening and closing tags.  After the opening tag on another line and indented in, you want to put your meta tag. This will provide metadata about the html document but will not show up in the webpage. It's merely a communication of sorts, to learn more <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_meta.asp">click here.</a>
					</p>
					<p>
						Then you want to put your <code>&lt;title&gt;</code> tag, this will show up in the tab that opens on the top of your computer screen.  Next you need your link to a stylesheet.  Any other links for internal purposes will go here. For example, if you want to use a cool font style, you may link to a google font page and more specifically to a certain font style.  Overall, the top of your html document should look something like this:<br>
					<div id="codehead">
						<code>&lt;head&gt;</code><br>
						<code>&lt;meta charset="utf-8" /&gt;</code><br>
						<code>&lt;title&gt;The Green Leaf&lt;/title&gt;</code><br>
						<code>&lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="css.index.css /&gt;</code><br>
						<code>&lt;link href='http://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Felipa' rel='stylesheet' type='text/css'&gt;</code><br>
						<code>&lt;/head&gt;</code>
					</div>
					</p>
					<p>
						Learn a little more about the attributes used in the <code>head</code> section by checking <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_meta.asp">w3schools.</a> And I'll be back tomorrow so we can start on the body and do some headings.
					</p>
					
					<h3>
						<a name="Aug17">
							August 17
						</a>
					</h3>

					<p>
						Ok, so today I'm going to go over the <code>body</code> tag and <code>headings</code>. The body tag is quite simple.  It will come after your <code>head</code> tag and will encompass all the content on your document that will eventually appear on your webpage. Body tags look like this:<br>
						<code>&lt;body&gt;&lt;/body&gt;</code>
					</p> 
					<p>
						Headings are, just like the name implies, headings.  This is the content that will standout to whoever looks at your webpage.  There are 6 heading types.  <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> is the biggest heading and it also carries the most weight to it.  What that means is when your site gets catalogued online, the h1 can give you Search Engine Optimization or simply, SEO.  Here is a <a href="http://www.verticalmeasures.com/resources/seo-tutorial-videos/using-h1-tag-improves-search-engine-ranking/">tutorial</a> all about h1 tags and SEO.  <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> is the biggest heading while <code>&lt;h6&gt;</code> is the smallest and has the least weight.  You can open an h1 and close it like this<br> 
						<code>&lt;h1&gt;Enter Any Text Here!!&lt;/h1&gt;</code><br>
						You can have as many different headings as you like.  Positioning all of them will come later.  
					</p>
					<p>
						Maybe you can try something like this but with your own name:<br>
						<code>&lt;h1&gt;Hello World!&lt;/h1&gt;</code><br>
						<code>&lt;h2&gt;My name is Adam.&lt;/h2&gt;</code><br>
						<a href="example1.html">See what this looks like</a><br>
						Or you can try it yourself on your own text editor, if you haven't downloaded one yet, <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/html/tryit.asp?filename=tryhtml_headers">try this!</a>
					</p>
					<p>
						So get a little comfortable with headings, I've got a boat ton of work to do, and I'll be back Monday. That's when we'll work on putting together images, paragraphs and other elements to fill out your webpage.
					</p>
					<h3>
						<a name="Aug23">
							August 23
						</a>
					</h3>
					<p>
						Ok, it's been a few days and I haven't posted yet.  Well there is a reason for that. I have just found out the hard way that you really need to link in resets to your html pages.  CSS resets are imperative.  Their purpose is to zero everything out so you can start your webpage with basically a clean canvas.  Not all people who go online use the same browser.  Some use Chrome, some use Firefox. Others use Safari, and those who don't know any better use Internet Explorer, lol!  No, I'm kidding, I don't mean to make fun.  But my point is that each of those browsers have different default settings that affect the look of your page when it's opened in that particular browser.  Certain browsers will have the default font set at serif, while others will have it as Times New Roman. In order to have your webpage look the same across the board, you are going to have to link up your html page to an external css reset file.  I have been using <a href="http://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/css/reset/">Eric Meyer's reset</a>.  Just copy Eric Meyer's reset, it's free, and paste it in a CSS file on your computer.  Then you can put the link to the reset in your <code>head</code> element, put it below the <code>title</code> tag and above the link to your other stylesheet.  That way it will zero everything out and it will allow you to style it the way you want to. There are other resets out there.  So please feel free to do some research. You might want to start <a href="http://sixrevisions.com/css/css-tips/css-tip-1-resetting-your-styles-with-css-reset/">here</a> when researching different resets.

					<p>
						Well, I am back after a little hiatus.  I had to figure out exactly where I wanted to go from here.  I have pretty much all of HTML and CSS down. The tags are becoming easier for me to remember and the properties and values of their counterpart declarations on CSS are too.
